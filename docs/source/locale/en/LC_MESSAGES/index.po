"The Canada Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation (CCMEO) Dissemination"
" Tool Kit (CDTK) allows users to instantiate geospatial services in a "
"controlled data repository. Standardization of the repository structure "
"and its access mechanism ensures the integrity of the data and services "
"published in the CDTK. QGIS Server, pyQGIS and PostgreSQL database "
"deployed in a cloud environment form the infrastructure behind the CDTK. "
"The cluster also incorporates a shared storage, an FTP server, a "
"database, and many other components needed by the system to perform its "
"tasks."

"The purpose of this document is to describe the input information "
"required to make the CDTK services work properly. It explains how to "
"create the different input packages used by its users to launch the CDTK "
"services. It is intended for use by anyone who has the rights to submit "
"data and web services to the CDTK with the possibility for its clients "
"who have less expertise in creating geospatial services to be able to "
"publish geospatial data on its own."
